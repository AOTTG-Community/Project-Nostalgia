<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


A team of old mod makers, influencers and fans of the original game deciding to work together to create 1 last update.

Here's why:
* Nostalgia.
* Some still care about the game.
* To test ourselves and see how much we've changed throughout the years.
* To finally work with other mod makers out there.


Of course, we don't want you to waste your time or dedicate your life to this. It's a fan project which you decide how much you work on. All contributions are accepted.
