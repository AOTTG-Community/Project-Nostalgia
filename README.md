<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A team of old mod makers, influencers and fans of the original game deciding to work together to create 1 last update.

**Here's why**:

- Nostalgia.
- The game's community is still going, we want to reinforce this!
- To test ourselves and see how much we've improved throughout the years.
- To finally work with other mod makers out there.

Of course, this being a fan project, we make no promises and take no vows - the project is maintained by hard working individuals who dedicate their free time, for free, we are not bound to work on this and do not owe the community anything.
_All contributions are accepted._
